# Technicolor - Customized by Mariano Morales

A customized theme based on [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) default theme and on  theme which is based on [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

For more information regarding how to use the theme with Ghost, please refer to the [original README](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper)

## Cutomizations

I like the default Casper theme that comes with a clean installation of Ghost a lot. As a matter of fact, my theme was inspired on [angristan.xyz](https://angristan.xyz) theme, and conserves some of its major hacks.

I additionally modified several things that didn't quite satisfy me yet. The changes consist mainly in

### CSS

Typography (FF Meta Web Pro, FF Enzo Web, FF Meta Pro)
Removed Post Feature Image
Modified Post Card Meta (Made author name thinner and added reading time JS)
Reduced width of content area (in post.hbs)
Removed the opacity layer from the header banner
Modified the post titles to float to the left and have a 'max-width: 620px' and have font-family: 'FF Meta Web Pro', sans-serif' which makes it look very cool.
Made images in posts smaller (and modified its margins and paddings)
Made pre and code have a light blue background and custom border-radius
Changed the subscribe button on the navigation menu for a "log-in" (fits my particular need better) and changed th border-radius to 3px instead of 10px.
